WHAT is qSheff
==============

qSheff, is a wrapper for the qmail-queue from EnderUNIX Software Development Team.
It scans emails against viruses and spams.

After spam and virus checking, qSheff will wake the qmail-queue.

qSheff, is simple and more powerful. It is more than a regular content filter.
Can perform spam filtering, attachment blocking, virus scanning and nice logging.
