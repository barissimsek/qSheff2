2. WHAT IS qSheff?

qSheff is a content scanner which can work with qmail e-mail server. It can
also be used as qmail-queue interface to execute other content scanners.
E-mails that contains spam or virus are blocked at SMTP level. Transfers clean
e-mails to queue.

Because qSheff runs at SMTP level, it fairly reduces servers load by cutting
e-mails before entering queue. For the best performance, it's fully coded in
pure C language.

qSheff offers much better features than alternatives.

Features:

 . ClamAv antivirus (With direct domain-socket communication)
 . Option to run external content filter or antivirus (custom program)
 . Ability to pass internal variables to external programs in the form
   of %%mailfrom%%, %%mailto%%, %%remoteip%%, %%msgfile%% and %%tempdir%%
 . Header and body filtering with the support of regular expressions
 . Attachment filtering
 . Protecting e-mails from predefined origin with ignore list (ignore list)
 . Quarantine support for spam and virus
 . Ability to store all e-mail traffic to local disk
 . Subject tagging for MUA's to write their own filters
 . Deleting content of infected e-mails and delivering to user with subject
   tag and predefined message
 . Blocking e-mails with broken headers
 . Detailed logging within one line
 . Logging to custom file or to syslog server
 . Clean C source code which is open to further development
 . Easy error detection and debugging
 . Ability to run with qmail-queue symbolic link after qmailqueue patch
 . Support for custom error patch. Can respond with user-defined error codes,
   can return the name of the virus or spam-catching rule
 . Ability to inactivate filtering for e-mails from local
 . Basic countermeasures for DOS attacks


3. WORKING THEORY

Without any plugins, qSheff can work like described below:

SMTP  --> tcpserver --> qmail-smtpd --
                                      | 
                                       --> qmail-queue --> 
                                      |
Local --> MUA --> qmail-inject -------


A qmail system with qsheff installed is shown below:

SMTP  --> tcpserver --> qmail-smtpd --
                                      | 
                                       --> qSheff --> qmail-queue --> 
                                      |
Local --> MUA --> qmail-inject -------

qmail picture: http://www.nrg4u.com/qmail/the-big-qmail-picture-103-p1.gif

In qmail, e-mail can enter queue in two ways: 1. If e-mail is from remote SMTP
server, with qmail-smtpd, 2. If e-mail from local user, with qmail-inject.
In both ways an e-mail enters queue through qmail-queue. qSheff stays on this
common point and directs all e-mail traffic to itself. There are to ways to
insert qSheff between qmail-queue and qmail-smtpd/qmail-inject

a. qmail-queue is renamed to qmail-queue.orig and qmail-queue is symbolic-
   linked to qSheff:

   # mv /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue.orig
   # ln -s /var/qmail/bin/qmail-qsheff /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue

   From this point, when qmail-smtpd or qmail-inject tried to run qmail-queue,
   qSheff is run with symbolic link and e-mail is delivered to qSheff via 
   standart input. After processing own tasks, qSheff runs qmail-queue.orig and
   delivers e-mail from standart output. E-mail goes its way likewise.

b. qmail is patched with qmailqueue patch. This patch is included within qSheff
   distribution under contrib/ folder. With this patch qmail checks for 
   QMAILQUEUE environment variable and runs the program claimed there. If
   QMAILQUEUE is defined as /var/qmail/bin/qmail-qsheff, qSheff is run by
   qmail-smtpd or qmail-inject directly. After processing own tasks, qSheff
   runs qmail-queue and delivers via standart output. E-mail goes its way.

qsheff proceeds to one of the below after processing own tasks:

a. Spam or virus is found.

   a) If Subject tag or virus tag is activated, subject is tagged and e-mail
   is delivered to user. If infected, e-mail content is completely replaced
   with a descriptive text and delivered to user afterwise.

   b) If subject tag or virus tag is inactive, responds with PERMANENTLY REJECTED
   If qmail is patched with "custom error patch", user is responded with a
   predefined error message. If quarantine is activated, e-mail is also
   saved to /var/qsheff/quarantine folder.


b. There is an error

   Then, responds with TEMPORARY REJECTED error.

c. "enable_blackhole = 1" is set

   This time, there is no remote response for the above two situations.

d. E-mail is clean

   E-mail is delivered to queue



4. PLATFORM SUPPORT

qSheff is written to run on different UNIX platforms. Systems below are teste
successfully.

Solaris 5.8 (gcc version 3.4.2)
OpenBSD 3.5 (gcc version 3.3.2)
FreeBSD 4.10 (gcc version 2.95.4 20020320)
FreeBSD 5.4 (gcc version 3.4.2)
GNU istanbuLX/Linux (gcc version 3.4.2)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 (gcc version 3.2.3 20030502)
GNU/Linux Debian (gcc 3.3.5, Debian 1:3.3.5-12)


5. INSTALLING

Installing qSheff is pretty easy. Before installing, remove other content fil-
tering software if exists (RAV, simscan, mailscanner, old versions of qSheff..)
Afterwards qmail-queue should be like below:

# ls -l /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue
-rws--x--x 1 qmailq qmail 12396 Nov 28 13:18 /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue

In orter to run qSheff, "ripmime" software of PLDaniels should be installed.
Ripmime splits e-mail into header, body and extensions parts. Ripmime can be
downloaded from http://www.pldaniels.com/ripmime/

# fetch http://pldaniels.com/ripmime/ripmime-1.4.0.6.tar.gz
ripmime-1.4.0.6.tar.gz                        100% of  159 kB   31 kBps

# tar -zxf ripmime-1.4.0.6.tar.gz
# cd ripmime-1.4.0.6
# make
# make install
# ripmime -V
v1.4.0.6 - December 12, 2005 (C) PLDaniels http://www.pldaniels.com/ripmime

Antivirus is an optional feature. qSheff, unlike other content filters, can
connect to ClamAv directly via socket for e-mail scanning. Does not run
client software like "clamdscan". This reduces using of system resources and
increases performance of filtering. In order to run other antivirus or
content scanner programs, "custom program" feature is used. Further
information about this feature is given below.

ClamAv can be downloaded and installed from http://www.clamav.net/

For installing and configuring other antivirus software, check their own
documentation.

qSheff can be downloaded from official site.

  --with-maxfiles                Maximum numbers of files in a dir.
  --with-qmailgroup              Define qmail group, default=qmail
  --with-qmaildir                Define qmail directory, default=/var/qmail
  --with-clamav                  Enable ClamAv
  --with-clamd-socket            Path to clamd socket, default=/tmp/clamd
  --with-custom-prog             Enable User Defined Program, check qsheff.conf

You can you any of these options.

A typical installation should be like this:

# ./configure --disable-local-users --with-clamav \
    --with-clamd-socket=/var/run/clamav/clamd

Options are described below. Installing should continue like this:

# make && make install
# /usr/local/etc/qsheff-II/install-wrapper.sh

After installing, /var/qmail/bin folder shoul be seen like:

-r-s--x--x  1 root    qmail  36766 17 May 16:57 qmail-qsheff
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root    qmail     27 16 May 15:28 qmail-queue -> qmail-qsheff
-r-s--x--x  1 qmailq  qmail  12396  2 May 15:43 qmail-queue.orig

Options:

  --enable-debug                 Enable debug messages
    Used for printing debugging information to screen in case of any problem

  --disable-local-users          Disable the filters for local users
    qSheff filters local users by default. Bu small corporations does not
    need this. This option deactivates this feature.

  --enable-syslog                Enable syslog messages
    Logging information is sent both to qsheff.log and to syslog. With this
    option, logs can be stored in a remote syslog server.

  --enable-backup                Enable backup
    Enables logging all incoming/outgoing e-mail traffic

  --enable-spam-tag              Enable Spam Tagging
    Instead of rejecting spammed e-mails, qSheff tags subject and delivers
    e-mail to user. Users can store these e-mails in a seperate folder by 
    writing their own rules in client side.

  --enable-virus-tag             Enable virus tagging
    Infected e-mail is delivered to user after replacing content with a
    warning text about the virus. This message is predefined as VIRI_CENSOED
    in src/main.h. custom_sign in qsheff.conf is appended to this message
    automatically.

  --enable-custom-error          Enable the custom error patch
    By default, qmail responds to users with "permanently error" in the case
    of spam or virus. Usually this response does not have much information.
    Bu option enables custom-error patch. But qmail should be patched with
    this patch before. Predefined messages are in src/main.h like DEFAULTMSG,
    SPAMMSG and VIRUSMSG. Messages are tagged with "SPAM" keyword or name of
    the virus automatically.

  --enable-qq-patch              Enable qmailqueue patch
    Enables qmail-queue patch. This patch should be applied before. More infor-
    mation is described in Chapter 3 WORKING PRINCIPLES. With this option,
    qSheff is triggered through QMAILQUEUE environment variable, not symbolic
    link. This environment variable usually assigned in /etc/tcp.smtp

  --with-max-bodyline            Maximum number of lines to filter, default=40
    Limits maximum number of lines in an e-mail to filter. Predefined value is
    40. This option is a countermeasure for DOS attacks which can be caused by
    sending very large e-mails. Spam words usually appear in first 10 lines.
    It's not needed to scan all of the body.

  --with-maxfiles                Maximum numbers of files in a dir.
    if --enable-backup is activated, qSheff logs all e-mail traffic. Every OS
    has limit for number of file entries in a folder. If this option is defined,
    qSheff will switch to next folder afterwards. qSheff assumes 32000 by default.

  --with-qmailgroup              Define qmail group, default=qmail
    if qmail is installed with a group id other than "qmail", should be specified
    here

  --with-qmaildir                Define qmail directory, default=/var/qmail
    If qmail is installed other than /var/qmail, should be specified here.

  --with-clamav                  Enable ClamAv
    Activates ClamAv antivirus software. If ClamAv is installed to nonstandart
    folder like /opt/clamav, this folder should be specifed here. Otherwise,
    ClamAv library functions will fail during make.

  --with-clamd-socket            Path to clamd socket, default=/tmp/clamd
    qSheff connects to ClamAv daemon directly throug UNIX socket. Path to socket
    should be specified here if different than /tmp/clamd. Another solution is
    changing LocalSocket variable to "/tmp/clamd" from clamd.conf

  --with-custom-prog             Enable User Defined Program, check 
    User can make qSheff run any program or script. 3rd party software, anti-
    virus programs or your own scripts can be run this way. Full path to 
    program/script and parameters is given as parameter. Internal variables
    can be passed to custom program like %%mailfrom%%, %%mailto%%, %%remoteip%%,
    %%msgfile%% ve %%tempdir%%. This parameters or path to program can be
    changed within qsheff.conf later.


6. CONFIGURATION

qSheff configuration files are placed in etc/qsheff-II under install directory

qsheff.conf:

QSHEFFDIR: qSheff folder. Contaions backup, quarantine, spool and tmp folders.
LOGFILE: Specifies the file which qSheff will write logs to.
RIPMIME: Specifies full path to ripmime binary. Automatically detected and 
written by qSheff in configure process.
debug_level: Logging level. Default value is 99 and logs everything. If you
set 14, then HEADER debugging informations will not be logged.

   2      QUEUE    
   3      VIRUS   
   5      CUSTOM 
  11      SPAM  
  13      ATTACH 
  15      HEADER
enable_blackhole: If set to 1, no response will be sent to sender of the mail
in case of error, spam or virus
paronia_level: Not yet implemented
drop_empty_from: If set to 1, qSheff rejects mails without a "From:" header.
enable_quarantine: If set to 1, spam or infected mails are quarantined.
enable_ignore_list: If set to 1, does not filter the mail addresses and ip
addresses in ignore list
enable_header_filter: If set to 1, header filter is activated
enable_body_filter: If set to 1, body filter is activated
enable_attach_filter: If set to 1, attachment filter is activated
enable_clamd: If set to 1, ClamAv virus checking is activated

CUSTOM_PROG: Spesifies the full path and parameters of custom program.
CUSTOM_RET_MIN: The minimum return value of custom program in case of a match
CUSTOM_RET_MAX: The maximum return value of custom program in case of a match
For example a custom prog which returns 5 for virus and returns 9 for spam
can be set with 5 as CUSTOM_RET_MIN and 9 as CUSTOM_RET_MAX
CUSTOM_RET_ERR: Value which custom program returns in case of error.
custom_sign: When virus tagging is enabled, this message is appended to the
warning mail. Can be company logo/signature. This message is also contaions
the information message which will be sent to user when "custom error" patch
is applied.
qsheff.attach: The list which attachment filter looks for matching
qsheff.ignore: The list of e-mail and ip addresses which will not be filtered
Regular expressions can be written. qSheff will try to match expressions
with remote side IP and sender email address.
qsheff.rules: Contains qSheff spesific rules. Rules beginning with "h" are
header rules. Rules in the same line like (rule1)(rule2) are operated with
logic AND and rules in different lines are operated with logic OR.


7. USAGE

After installing qSheff, log file should be examined in order to be sure that
everything is fine.

If filtering local users is deactivated, attempts from server will not be logged
in log file.

If drop_empty_from=1 is set, attempts without "From:" line will be rejected and
logged with HEADER tag.

If there is an error after qSheff delivers mail to qmail-queue, qmail-queue's
exit value will be logged as exitcode.
